      <h2><u>My favorite Hobby</h2></u>
      <p>I love working on cars, currently have two cars that are very close to my heart and they are my 2015 Mustang Gt and then I have my 99 Mustang Gt, the 99 Gt is my project car which i am in the midst to almost completing the car. It is expensive to be a gearhead in cars but its also a huge stress reliever.</p>

      <p>I plan on making a Youtube channel and I also have a side hustle I detail cars for cheap price one my best selling details on the exterior of a car would be the ceramic wax I do for cars to keep them shining for a whole year even through the winter.</p>
